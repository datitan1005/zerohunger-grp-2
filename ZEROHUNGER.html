        <p>This project aims to address the critical issue of hunger by promoting sustainable practices and innovative solutions. Hunger has been a persistent problem in our continent, with many communities struggling to access nutritious food. Our approach includes utilizing leftovers creatively, educating the public on sustainable food practices, and advocating for policy changes to support food security.</p>
        <p>For instance, using onion peelings to make onion spice, or turning old bananas into delicious banana cake, can significantly reduce food waste and provide nutritious alternatives. By raising awareness and offering practical solutions, we hope to make a tangible impact on reducing hunger in our communities.</p>
        <p>Additionally, our project involves collaborating with students to ensure surplus produce is distributed to those in need rather than going to waste. Together, we can create a future where no one has to go to bed hungry.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on repurposing fruit leftovers to make nutritious fruit smoothies. This initiative not only reduces food waste but also provides healthy options for our community. We believe that small changes in our daily habits can lead to significant improvements in food security and environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p>In addition to making fruit smoothies, we also teach people about the importance of reducing food waste and how they can contribute to zero hunger efforts. We encourage everyone to share their experiences, spread the word, and participate in our mission to eradicate hunger.</p>
